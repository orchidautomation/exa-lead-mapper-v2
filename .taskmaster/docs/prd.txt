Business Mapper API MVP Performance Improvements PRD

## Project Overview
Optimize the Business Mapper API MVP to improve speed, ensure consistent results, and reduce API costs. Focus on quick wins that can be implemented without major architectural changes.

## Core Objectives
1. Improve API response speed by 40-60%
2. Reduce API costs by 30-50%
3. Ensure consistent, high-quality search results
4. Maintain backward compatibility with existing API

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Serper API Batch Request Optimization
- Implement connection reuse for multiple vertical searches
- Create true batch processing in _execute_batch_request()
- Reduce connection overhead and latency
- Target: 40-60% reduction in API latency

### 2. Smart Search Result Caching
- Implement in-memory caching for search results
- Cache TTL: 1-2 hours for search results
- Cache key: hash of vertical + location + zoom + page
- Integrate with existing ValidationCache system
- Target: 70-80% cache hit rate after warm-up

### 3. Adaptive Location Clustering
- Make clustering thresholds dynamic based on business density
- Adjust overlap thresholds after initial cluster search
- Implement business density heuristics
- Target: 15-25% reduction in total API calls

### 4. Quality-Based Early Termination
- Add AI validation score threshold to pagination logic
- Stop pagination when average confidence < 0.6
- Implement quality degradation detection
- Target: 10-20% cost reduction by avoiding low-quality pages

### 5. Batch AI Validation Processing
- Process 10-20 validations per single Groq API call
- Implement async validation pipeline
- Maintain validation accuracy while reducing calls
- Target: 50-70% faster validation, 30-40% AI cost reduction

## Technical Requirements
- Python 3.11+ compatibility
- No new external dependencies
- Maintain existing API interface
- Add performance metrics logging
- Implement gradual rollout capability

## Success Metrics
- API response time: < 10 seconds for typical search
- Cost per search: < $0.05 for standard query
- Cache hit rate: > 70% after 24 hours
- Error rate: < 1% increase from baseline
- Result quality: Maintain 95%+ validation accuracy

## Implementation Timeline
- Week 1: Serper optimization + Result caching
- Week 2: Location clustering + Early termination
- Week 3: AI batch validation + Testing

## Risk Mitigation
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Comprehensive logging for monitoring
- Rollback plan for each improvement
- A/B testing capability for validation
